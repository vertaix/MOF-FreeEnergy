### Preparing the data
Refer to this [notebook](/n/fs/rnspace/projects/vertaix/MOF-FreeEnergy/data_preparation.ipynb).

### Training
Run 
```python
python src/llmprop_train.py
```

### Evaluating
Run 
```python
python src/llmprop_evaluate.py
```

### TODO
More details about how to process the data, train and evaluate our method will be added soon
